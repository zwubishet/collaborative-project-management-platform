## How to Test
- Use **GraphQL Playground** to test all queries, mutations, and subscriptions
- Use **Postman** or **Insomnia** to test REST authentication endpoints
- Real-time updates for tasks and notifications can be verified by opening multiple clients

---

## Notes / Known Issues
- Make sure WebSocket port is open for subscriptions
- JWT expiration is 15 minutes; refresh manually during testing
